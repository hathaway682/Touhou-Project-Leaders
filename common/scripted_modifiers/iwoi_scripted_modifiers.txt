#You can create new modifiers here. There are various settings available which will affect how it displays in tooltips.
#Note that any modifier created here will do nothing by default. You need to manually give it effects.
#And example would be by putting "mult = modifier:my_modifier" in certain triggered modifiers or resource tables. See 01_ruler_jobs.txt/head_researcher and 04_species_traits.txt/trait_charismatic for examples.

#Settings:
	# icon: name of file in gfx\interface\icons\modifiers (without the .dds). Default is "mod_" + key
	# percentage: show as a % or not (default: no)
	# min_mult: sets the minimum this modifier can be when used as a multiplier in the source code (so probably not relevant since this modifier will not be applied in the source code - but you could theoretically overwrite a code-generated modifier here). Default 0
	# max_decimals: default 2
	# good: sets if it registers as "good" (i.e. a positive number is green, a negative red). Default no.
	# neutral: sets if no value is either good or bad (all is yellow). Default no.
	# hidden: probably hides it in tooltips? requirement testing. Default no.
	# no_diff: not sure what this does either. Default no
	# cap_zero_to_one: ditto. Default no
	# localize_with_value_key: expects you to put $VALUE$ in the loc key (the number will be printed there). Default no
	# category: sets the modifier category, which is sometimes used to determine whether it is applied to a certain object (so make sure this is set to what you want)
	#	In other words, this is referring to the object that the modifier is read from. I.e. where you could get its value via check_modifier_value, for instance.
	# 	It should be set to the lowest possible place in the hierarchy, where country is the top, then planet would be in the middle, and pop would be at the bottom.
	# 	Possible values: all, pop, ship, station, fleet, country, army, leader, planet, component, pop_faction (currently unused, do not use), deposit,
	# 		megastructure, habitability, starbase, economic_unit, system, trade, federation, espionage
